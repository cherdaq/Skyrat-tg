changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed smoothing turfs displaying some incorrect damaged overlays because of a non-smoothing damage overlay of different dimensions than the smoothing sprite used as the base. Less black void, let's go!"
  - image: "Added smooth broken/burnt overlays for grass, meaning that it's going to look a lot less broken when the grass tile is at the edge of a smoothing group."
